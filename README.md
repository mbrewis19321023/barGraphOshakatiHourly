# This is the developemnt history

## V1
- V1.0 This was an initial upload and who knows what it was about.
- V1.1 You were able to change the csvToPickle sothat it works with Cenored and not just pnpscada. Things to fix: 1. The average is centred around the hour mark and not the half hour mark. 2. You need to capture more info in the original dataframe.
- V1.2 you captured more data into the frame in this version. In addition you built in a soft toggle to change from hourly average to monthly sum
